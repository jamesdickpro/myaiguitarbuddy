### 🎸 How This Blog Got Started: Building MyAIGuitarBuddy with AI

This post is a behind-the-scenes look at how I used ChatGPT to help brainstorm, refine, and launch *MyAIGuitarBuddy* — a blog that blends my love of guitar with curiosity about artificial intelligence. I wanted to keep it light, personal, and exploratory.

Here’s how it all came together:

---

## 💡 The Initial Idea

**My prompt:**
> *"I want to create a blog called MyAIGuitarBuddy and I need to write the introductory blog post. I want to host it on GitHub using Jekyll."*

From that, ChatGPT created a thoughtful and ambitious first post draft. It had sections like “Why This Blog?”, “What You’ll Find Here,” and “Join the Journey,” laying out a grand vision of exploring AI, guitar, music theory, creativity, and more.

---

## ✂️ Scaling It Back

I liked the tone, but the vision was a bit too much for a beginner's project.

**My next prompt:**
> *"Great post, but a little too ambitious. Can you update the 'What You'll Find Here' section to something like exploring how AI can help me get back into guitar, understanding how AI works while doing something I enjoy, learning new songs, etc."*

ChatGPT revised it with a gentler scope — one focused on learning, enjoyment, and curiosity.

---

## 🎵 Tone Tweaks

Later, I asked to remove specific music genres from the “Join the Journey” section:

> *"In the 'Join the Journey' section, please remove the genre references."*

That change made the writing more personal and open-ended.

---

## 🛠️ Turning Text Into a Blog

Once the welcome post was written, I asked:

> *"Yes please generate the markdown file and create some tags to indicate this was generated by you."*

ChatGPT created a well-formatted Jekyll-compatible `.md` file, complete with tags and front matter.

## 🚧 GitHub Setup Help

Then I needed help with the technical side of GitHub Pages and Jekyll:

- **How to create the `_posts/` folder through the GitHub browser**
- **How to select a more stylish theme**
- **How to configure the Minimal Mistakes theme correctly**
- **Why my CSS wasn't showing up**
- **How to fix layout and missing navigation in blog posts**
- **How to add an avatar (yes, JPG works!)**

---

## Reflections

ChatGPT explained each step clearly and walked me through the exact files and settings I needed for the most part.  ChatGPT struggled a bit with creating a sidebar nav of the tags.  To be fair, I don't really know Jekyll or Liquid very well, so I admit I may have not been asking the best questions.  I spent time looking at the generated HTML and moving it around in Chrome before figuring out how to modify the generated code.  This is in line with what I have heard about coding with an AI assistant.  The focus shifts from writing code to tweaking, testing and debugging.  I think ChatGPT got me about 75% of the way to the blog I wanted and I am happy with the results.

## ✅ What's Next

This post — like the rest of the blog — was created with ChatGPT’s help. It’s both a writing partner and a technical assistant, helping me learn as I build.

If you’re thinking of starting a blog, reviving a hobby, or exploring AI in your own creative way, maybe this kind of collaboration can help you too.

Let’s keep learning — and playing — together.
