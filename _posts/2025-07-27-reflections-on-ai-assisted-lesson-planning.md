# Original Lesson Plan "Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)" by Green Day, plus iterations

---

## 🎯 Goals by End of Week

- Play the intro picking cleanly and consistently  
- Strum all verse/chorus sections in time  
- Memorize the chord progression  
- Play through the entire song with minimal mistakes  
- (Optional) Sing and play or record yourself performing

---

## 🗓️ Daily Practice Schedule

### **Day 1 – Chord Shapes & Transitions**
- Chords: G, Cadd9, D, Em
- Practice transitions, especially G → Cadd9 → D
- Drill chord changes at a slow tempo with a metronome

✅ *Tip:* Pivot between G and Cadd9 using shared fingers.

---

### **Day 2 – Intro Picking Pattern**
- Pattern:
  - G: 6–4–3–2  
  - Cadd9: 5–4–3–2  
  - D: 4–3–2–3  
- Practice each pattern slowly, then combine into the intro loop

✅ *Challenge:* Play the intro 3× in a row cleanly at 60 bpm.

---

### **Day 3 – Verse & Chorus Strumming**
- Strumming pattern: `D – D U – U D U`
- Practice over G → Cadd9 → D → G
- Play with a backing track (slow tempo)

---

### **Day 4 – Play Verse & Chorus Together**
- Combine verse + chorus chords and strumming
- Focus on dynamic changes (soft/loud strums)
- Play along with original track (75% speed)

---

### **Day 5 – Bridge & Full Song**
- Bridge chords: Em – D – C – G – Em – D – C
- Play full song from intro to end
- Try to play without sheet music

---

### **Day 6 – Singing and Performance**
- Hum then sing while playing
- Focus on syncing lyrics with rhythm
- Record yourself for playback and feedback

---

### **Day 7 – Final Polish**
- Play along with full original track
- Focus on expression, tone, and dynamics
- Record a clean performance

---

## 🛠️ Iteration Summary: Refinements to the Lesson Plan

## 🛠️ Lesson Plan Iteration Summary

### 🔄 Original Assumption:
- The lesson plan treated the progression as:  
  `G – Cadd9 – D – G` with each chord lasting a **full bar** (4 beats).

### 🔍 Correction #1 – Chord Timing:
- Identified that the **G chord lasts one full bar**, but **Cadd9 and D each get half a bar** (2 beats each).
- This clarified the true phrasing:  
  `| G (4 beats) | Cadd9 (2 beats) / D (2 beats) |`

### 🎵 Correction #2 – Picking Pattern:
- Updated picking to reflect the true time value:
  - G: full bar (e.g., 6–4–3–2)
  - Cadd9: 5–4 (beats 1-2)
  - D: 4–3 (beats 3-4)

### 🧱 Structural Clarification:
- Corrected how verse lines map to bars and beat counts.
- Emphasized strumming transitions at **mid-bar** for Cadd9 → D.
- Clarified that the **chorus chords (Em, G, D)** get full bars.

### ✅ Outcome:
- The final lesson plan accurately reflects:
  - Chord durations per bar
  - Syncing transitions with beats
  - Picking vs. strumming structure
- This ensures better rhythm and flow for learners.

# Original Lesson Plan "I Think I’m OKAY" by Machine Gun Kelly (feat. YUNGBLUD & Travis Barker), plus iterations

---

## 🎶 Song Overview

- **Artist**: Machine Gun Kelly (feat. YUNGBLUD & Travis Barker)  
- **Released**: 2019  
- **Tuning**: Standard (E A D G B E)  
- **Style**: Pop Punk / Alternative Rock  
- **Techniques**: Power chords, melodic riffing, palm muting, rhythm transitions

---

## 🧩 Sections

### 1. 🎸 Main Melodic Riff (Intro)

This is the iconic hook that plays over the intro beat before the verse power chords:

```
G|---7-4-4-0-0---7-4-4-0-0---7-4-4-0-0---5-4-4-0-0---
D|5--------------5--------------5--------------5-----
```

- **Start** on G7 + D5
- **Descend** to G4, then G open
- Repeat the motif with slight variation at the end (G5 instead of G7)

Play this section with light distortion and precise timing.

---

### 2. 🔥 Power Chord Rhythm Section

After the intro, MGK kicks into the rhythm part using palm-muted power chords:

```
e|---------------------------|
B|---------------------------|
G|-------------------9-9-9---|
D|-2-2-2-5-5-5---7-7---------|
A|-2-2-2-5-5-5---7-7---------|
E|-0-0-0-3-3-3---5-5---------|
```


- **E5 - G5 - A5 - B5** power chord progression
- Tight palm muting on the low E and A strings
- Very punchy and rhythmic

---

### 3. 🧠 Practice Tips

- Loop the melodic riff separately until it's fluid.
- Use a metronome at 90 BPM to build rhythm control.
- Focus on dynamics—clean riff, heavier power chords.
- Play along with the track for timing and tone.

---

## ✅ Next Steps

- Learn the **verse chord voicings** and **chorus changes**.
- Add vocal phrasing or melody on top of the power chords.
- Experiment with tone matching (light breakup for the riff, more drive for chorus).

## 🛠️ Iteration Summary: Refinements to the Lesson Plan

### 🧪 Original Prompt

User asked:  
> “What is the riff for MGK’s I Think I am okay song?”

### ❌ First Attempt

- I mistakenly identified the **power chord rhythm** section (E5–G5–A5–B5) as the main riff.
- This was a rhythm progression—not the melodic lead the user meant.

### 🧠 Clarification by User

> “That’s the rhythm not the riff. A riff is usually a melody or series of notes.”

This helped narrow the focus toward the melodic intro hook.

### 🔍 Research Iteration

- I checked more trusted tabs and video lessons (GuitarZero2Hero, Songsterr, Guitartabcreator).
- Discovered the accurate **melodic riff uses frets 7, 4, 0, 5** on the G and D strings.

### ✅ Final Correction

- Provided the **accurate melodic riff** using G string (7–4–0) and D string (5).
- Confirmed it matched the GuitarZero2Hero video and tab creators.

### 🎉 Lesson Plan Finalized

- Combined melodic riff + rhythm chords
- Added structured practice tips
- Included next steps for full song learning
