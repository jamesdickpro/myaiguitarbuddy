- this post is reflecting on what I have learned and tried to do with ChatGPT and guitar practice

- co-write with ChatGPT.  Awesome.  A huge time saver.  Refining the posts were easy.  I could add or remove sections as necessary.  I could focus on a particular section and refine it and leave the rest of the post intact.
- what could be better?  e.g. the chord diagrams had to be requested separately and they were located in the middle of the post.  Subsequent iteration of Ball and Chain to standard tuning and capo first fret included the chord diagrams automaticallly

- publish the conversation summaries for lesson blog posts

- check the Ball and Chain first suggestion vs. numbered chords (e.g. I-V-VI-1 => D-A-G-D).  First suggestion was Eb major when the song is in Db major.  This was wrong.  It struggled to transpose the song to standard tuning with a capo.
- treated this as create a lesson and post to the blog.  Learned the first week the lessons should be more dynamic.  e.g. once the chords were masters, remove those and add something new.  If the lessons are for personal consumption and won't be shared with the world then there is no need for a blog post.  Just work directlying with ChatGPT.
- Good Riddance (Time of Your Life) was just wrong to begin with.  Needed to guide ChatGPT to get to something.  TODO: write the tutorial I want.
- Learned that I am better off using YouTube video lessons that relying on ChatGPT for the chords and riffs.

- maybe have a separate post for just adding the sidebar nav of tags.  Struggle to get the write answer from ChatGPT, but to be fair, I don't really know Jekyll and Liquid either.  Spent time looking at the generated HTML and moving it around in Chrome.
- great for creating the blog.  ChatGPT got me 75% of what I wanted to do with GitHub Pages and Jekyll.  The remainder I closed by reviewing the code, Googling and tweaking here and there.
