## 🔁 Strumming Pattern Daily Drill

**Pattern**:  
`D – D U – U D U`

Start at **60 bpm** and gradually increase to **135 bpm** using a metronome. Focus on relaxed motion and internal timing.

> 🎯 **Tip**: Mute the strings with your fretting hand and practice this pattern as a rhythm-only drill to improve consistency.

## 🪜 Next Steps

1. **Learn the Intro / Solo Riff**  
2. **Sing Along While Playing**  
3. **Record Yourself**  
4. **Explore Improvisation**

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

If something sounds off while you're playing, **trust your ears**. Tuning, chord voicings, or performance style might vary between studio, live, and cover versions — and it’s always possible we got something wrong. Your ears are the final authority.
