## 🔁 Strumming Pattern Daily Drill

**Pattern**:  
`D – D U – U D U`

Start with a **metronome at 60 bpm**, then gradually increase to **135 bpm**. Focus on even, relaxed motion and steady tempo.

> 🎯 **Tip**: For rhythm-only practice, **mute the strings with your fretting hand** (lightly rest your fingers across the strings without pressing down) and focus purely on **timing and groove**. This helps internalize the strumming pattern without worrying about chord transitions.

## 🪜 Next Steps

1. **Learn the Intro / Solo Riff**  
2. **Sing Along While Playing**  
3. **Record Yourself**  
4. **Explore Improvisation**

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

If something sounds off while you're playing, **trust your ears**. Tuning, chord voicings, or performance style might vary between studio, live, and cover versions — and it’s always possible we got something wrong. Your ears are the final authority.
